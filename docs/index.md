## A community united by mutual support for human scale transportation options

Car Free Tahoe is a community of people in South Lake Tahoe who believe in the freedom to live without a car. We believe that a city where it is easy to get around without a car is a better place to live. We come together in solidarity, so that we don't feel alone walking or rolling in a place designed for cars. We come together with support, to help each other get around.
